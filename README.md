#### A lightweight Chrome extension that displays the expected value (EV) of crafting Steam trading card badges directly on app's page.
>
> - It fetches current marketplace prices for cards, backgrounds, and emoticons, computes weighted averages. 
> - Returns an expected profit or loss on each craft with a link to the app's badge page.

#### Weighted EV Calculation

 Uses the steam badge craft probability distribution to compute:
>  Average background value
> <br> Average emoticon value
> <br> Total EV = (bgEV + emoEV) − crafting cost
