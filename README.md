> - It fetches current marketplace prices for cards, backgrounds, and emoticons, computes weighted averages. 
> - Returns an expected profit or loss on each craft with a link to the app's badge page.

#### Weighted EV Calculation

> <br> Average background value
> <br> Average emoticon value
> <br> Total EV = (bgEV + emoEV) − crafting cost
